  <p>The sea covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface. Now for the first time in history more than half the world's people live in cities and many of the world's most populated conurbations are located on the ocean periphery. Climate change is making littoral zones a potentially productive location for the development of new forms of urban space in coastal cities. Increased urbanisation and the foregrounding of the coastal condition make the association between cities and the sea one of the most important environmental juxtapositions of the 21st century. The aim of this paper is to re-theorise the collision of the public realm and the sea edge, and provide a range of design precedents for this emerging urban space phenomenon. The paper will introduce the concept of 'bluespace' and define a matrix with nine instances of how urban space and sea space combine to produce distinct public space types in port cities. Case studies of each type will be presented and discussed in detail with reference to textual and representational descriptions of the space in question.</p>
  <p>This paper demonstrates that by mapping maritime functions onto urban space typologies, a new category of urban space called bluespace can be defined. A typological approach is useful because it takes what are essentially formal types related to maritime infrastructure and indexes them to a recognised set of urban spaces. Maritime spaces themselves have been subject to dramatic changes in form and scale over the last 500 years making a range of analogies possible. This is a direct result of the development of marine technologies and imperial projects of global colonisation and trade. While the nine forms of bluespace identified are discussed as single types they can also overlap and combine. Maritime Highways can incorporate whole port cities. Harbour arenas can be edged with beaches. Piers can extend the space of the beach and containers can be located on docks canals or waterfront squares. The importance of the matrix is that it develops a space vocabulary specific to a port city.
  The paper serves to highlight how harbour space is an integral part of the urban public space of the seaport. In spite of being historically overlooked, bluespace has traditionally been part of the harbour city, particularly in the settlements of maritime colonisers such as the British and Portuguese. Urban ceremonial space in Portugal and Brazil, and dockside commercial space in Europe, Australia and New Zealand have em
  braced this realm, activated the landâ€“sea margins, and expanded the conceptual space of the city into the harbour itself. In the 21st century and beyond rising sea levels will reshape port cities and present challenges and opportunities to further articulate this space. This study provides an initial theoretical position from which to proceed.</p>

  <!--<p>Someone who writes books is either everything (a unique universe in himself and to all others) or nothing. And because it will never be given to anyone to be everything, all of us who write books are nothing. We are unrecognized, jealous, embittered, and we wish the others dead. In that we are all equals: Banaka, Bibi, I, and Goethe.</p>

  <p>The irresistible proliferation of graphomania among politicians, taxi drivers, childbearers, lovers, murderers, thieves, prostitutes, officials, doctors, and patients shows me that everyone without exception bears a potential writer within him, so that the entire human species has good reason to go down into the streets and shout: "We are all writers!"</p>

  <p>For everyone is pained by the thought of disappearing, unheard and unseen, into an indifferent universe, and because of that everyone wants, while there is still time, to turn himself into a universe of words.</p>

  <p>One morning (and it will be soon), when everyone wakes up as a writer, the age of universal deafness and incomprehension will have arrived.</p> -->
